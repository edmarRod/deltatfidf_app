# Delta Tfidf App

This app shows the vocabulary featurization created from delta tf-idf for binary classification.

It was deployed using heroku: [here](https://deltatfidf.herokuapp.com/)

With this app you can see the associated delta idf for the vocabulary extracted from the corpus.

You can change to see the IDF within a certain range or eliminate too common or rare words based on 
their document frequency.
